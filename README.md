A project for university studies in python. JARVIS is a voice assistant that has in its capabilities: 
- opening youtube and searching for videos on it
- google search for whatever the user says
- search on wikipedia 
- check the weather
- checking current data on sars-cov-2
- movie ranking 
- opening applications on your computer in this case:

My part of the project work was to lead and plan the whole project and to create the voice engine function, 
the welcome function, the acceptance of commands from the user, the youtube and google search engines
